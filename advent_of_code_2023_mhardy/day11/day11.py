# --- Day 11: Cosmic Expansion ---
# You continue following signs for "Hot Springs" and eventually come across an observatory. 
# The Elf within turns out to be a researcher studying cosmic expansion using the giant 
# telescope here.

# He doesn't know anything about the missing machine parts; he's only visiting for 
# this research project. However, he confirms that the hot springs are the next-closest 
# area likely to have people; he'll even take you straight there once he's done with 
# today's observation analysis.

# Maybe you can help him with the analysis to speed things up?

# The researcher has collected a bunch of data and compiled the data into a single giant 
# image (your puzzle input). The image includes empty space (.) and galaxies (#). For example:

# ...#......
# .......#..
# #.........
# ..........
# ......#...
# .#........
# .........#
# ..........
# .......#..
# #...#.....
# The researcher is trying to figure out the sum of the lengths of the shortest path 
# between every pair of galaxies. However, there's a catch: the universe expanded in the 
# time it took the light from those galaxies to reach the observatory.

# Due to something involving gravitational effects, only some space expands. 
# In fact, the result is that any rows or columns that contain no galaxies should all 
# actually be twice as big.

# In the above example, three columns and two rows contain no galaxies:

#    v  v  v
#  ...#......
#  .......#..
#  #.........
# >..........<
#  ......#...
#  .#........
#  .........#
# >..........<
#  .......#..
#  #...#.....
#    ^  ^  ^
# These rows and columns need to be twice as big; the result of cosmic expansion 
# therefore looks like this:

# ....#........
# .........#...
# #............
# .............
# .............
# ........#....
# .#...........
# ............#
# .............
# .............
# .........#...
# #....#.......
# Equipped with this expanded universe, the shortest path between every pair of 
# galaxies can be found. It can help to assign every galaxy a unique number:

# ....1........
# .........2...
# 3............
# .............
# .............
# ........4....
# .5...........
# ............6
# .............
# .............
# .........7...
# 8....9.......
# In these 9 galaxies, there are 36 pairs. Only count each pair once; order within 
# the pair doesn't matter. For each pair, find any shortest path between the two 
# galaxies using only steps that move up, down, left, or right exactly one . or # at a time. 
# (The shortest path between two galaxies is allowed to pass through another galaxy.)

# For example, here is one of the shortest paths between galaxies 5 and 9:

# ....1........
# .........2...
# 3............
# .............
# .............
# ........4....
# .5...........
# .##.........6
# ..##.........
# ...##........
# ....##...7...
# 8....9.......
# This path has length 9 because it takes a minimum of nine steps to get from 
# galaxy 5 to galaxy 9 (the eight locations marked # plus the step onto galaxy 9 itself). 
#                       Here are some other example shortest path lengths:

# Between galaxy 1 and galaxy 7: 15
# Between galaxy 3 and galaxy 6: 17
# Between galaxy 8 and galaxy 9: 5
# In this example, after expanding the universe, the sum of the shortest path between all 
# 36 pairs of galaxies is 374.

# Expand the universe, then find the length of the shortest path between every pair of 
# galaxies. What is the sum of these lengths?

# --- Part Two ---
# The galaxies are much older (and thus much farther apart) than the researcher 
# initially estimated.

# Now, instead of the expansion you did before, make each empty row or column one 
# million times larger. That is, each empty row should be replaced with 1000000 
# empty rows, and each empty column should be replaced with 1000000 empty columns.

# (In the example above, if each empty row or column were merely 10 times larger, 
#  the sum of the shortest paths between every pair of galaxies would be 1030. 
#  If each empty row or column were merely 100 times larger, the sum of the shortest 
#  paths between every pair of galaxies would be 8410. However, your universe will 
#  need to expand far beyond these values.)

# Starting with the same initial image, expand the universe according to these new 
# rules, then find the length of the shortest path between every pair of galaxies. 
# What is the sum of these lengths?

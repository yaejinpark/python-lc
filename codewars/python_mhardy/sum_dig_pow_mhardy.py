# The number 89 is the first integer with more than one digit that fulfills the property
# partially introduced in the title of this kata. What's the use of saying "Eureka"? 
# Because this sum gives the same number.

# In effect: 89 = 8^1 + 9^2

# The next number in having this property is 135.

# See this property again: 135 = 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3

# We need a function to collect these numbers, that may receive two integers a, b 
# that defines the range [a, b] (inclusive) and outputs a list of the sorted numbers 
# in the range that fulfills the property described above.

# Let's see some cases (input -> output):

# 1, 10 -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# 1, 100 -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 89]
# If there are no numbers of this kind in the range [a, b] the function should output an empty list.

# 90, 100 --> []

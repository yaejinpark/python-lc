-- Task
-- Given the database where users are stored in JSON format, fetch the records splitting the data into separate columns.

-- Notes
-- The private field determines whether the user's email address should be publicly visible
-- If the profile is private, email_address should equal "Hidden"
-- The users may have multiple email addresses
-- If no email addresses are provided, email_address should equal "None"
-- If there're multiple email addresses, the first one should be shown
-- The date_of_birth is in the yyyy-mm-dd format
-- The age fields represents the user's age in years
-- Order the result by the first_name, and last_name columns


SELECT 
    data ->> 'first_name' as first_name, 
    data ->> 'last_name' as last_name, 
    EXTRACT(years FROM age(now(), (data ->> 'date_of_birth')::date)) as age,
CASE
    WHEN (data ->> 'private') = 'true' THEN 'Hidden'
    WHEN (data ->> 'email_addresses') IS NULL THEN 'None'
    WHEN data ->> 'private' = 'false' AND data #>> '{email_addresses, 0}' IS NULL THEN 'None'
    ELSE data#>> '{email_addresses,0}'

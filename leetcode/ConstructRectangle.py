"""
A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size.
 So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, 
 whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.

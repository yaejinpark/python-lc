"""
Write a program that takes an array A and an index i into A, and rearrange the elements
such that all elements less than A[i] (pivot) appear first, followed by elements equal to the pivot,
followed by elements greater than the pivot.

Example: Given an index 3 for array [1,0,1,1,2,1,1], [1,1,0,1,1,1,2] is a valid answer.

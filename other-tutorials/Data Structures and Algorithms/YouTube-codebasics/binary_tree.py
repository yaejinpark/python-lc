# Searching elements is fast because every time I'm looking for an element, I'm halving the search base (right and left)
# That's why the search complexity is O(log n)

# Two ways of searching in a BST - Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS).

# BFS

# DFS
# In order traversal
# Pre order traversal
# Post order traversal
